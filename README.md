## About The Project

This project is a fully functional conversational AI assistant built using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern. The goal was to create a chatbot that could act as a knowledgeable and reliable tour guide for a specific domain. In this case, famous landmarks in France, without the risk of AI hallucination.

The application ingests data from live web pages, processes it into a searchable vector knowledge base, and uses this knowledge base to provide grounded, context-aware answers to user questions. It is designed to be conversational, capable of handling follow-up questions and topic changes intelligently.

## Key Features

*   **Web-Aware Data Ingestion:** Automatically scrapes and processes text from a list of URLs (Wikipedia articles) to build its knowledge base.
*   **Conversational RAG Pipeline:** Implements an advanced RAG architecture:
    *   **Question Rewriting:** Uses an LLM to rephrase follow-up questions into self-contained queries, ensuring accurate context is maintained.
    *   **Retrieval:** Performs semantic search against a FAISS vector store to find the most relevant information.
    *   **Generation:** Uses the Groq API with Llama3 to generate answers that are strictly grounded in the retrieved context.
*   **Conversational Memory:**
    *   Maintains a short-term chat history to understand follow-up questions.
    *   Tracks used documents to avoid giving repetitive answers in a longer conversation.
*   **Hallucination Prevention:** The system prompt is engineered to force the LLM to rely solely on the provided documents, politely declining to answer if the information is not in its knowledge base.
*   **Source Transparency:** Displays the exact source text that was used to generate an answer, providing verifiability for the user.

## Tech Stack

*   **LLM & API:** Groq API (Llama3 8B)
*   **AI Framework:** LangChain
*   **Vector Store:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
*   **Embedding Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
*   **Web Framework:** Flask
*   **Core Libraries:** `python-dotenv`, `beautifulsoup4`, `numpy`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dineshgopim/travel_assistance-.git
    cd travel_assistant
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    *   This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   Activate the environment:
        *   On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
        *   On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    *   Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env`.
    *   Inside this file, add your Groq API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Build the knowledge base:**
    *   First, you need to run the ingestion script to scrape the web pages and build the FAISS vector store. This only needs to be done once.
    ```sh
    python ingest_web.py
    ```

2.  **Start the Flask server:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Open the application in your browser:**
    *   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
